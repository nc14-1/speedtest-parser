# Speedtest Parser

This repository is meant to hold scripts (for Windows, MacOS, and Linux) to periodically measure internet speeds and log the results into a single, contained file. Currently, it is in development using the [Speedtest CLI Tool](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) from [Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/) (downloaded separately and ignored in git commits for legal reasons). However, plans are in place to have this tool work with the [Speedtest Tool](https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/) provided by [Measurement Labs](https://www.measurementlab.net/) (as this solution is open-source, for those who wish to use open-source tools).

As of right now, there is only compatibility with Windows as this tool was written in Powershell. (Excuse the mess, it was my first time writing anything in Powershell.) I hope to expand the compatibility to cover all sorts of operating systems (MacOS, Linux, BSD, Windows, and Android), however as this is _very much_ a side-project of mine, development time may not be reasonable.
